# Minichat

## Description

The aim of this project is to compare the use and performance of system calls for multiplexing.

in this project i'm redoing 3 minichat servers one with select, poll and epoll with (advantages/disadvantages)

I have not yet tested libuv, libev, or liburing (io_uring) nor have I tried kqueue, which is relatively close to epoll. In the future, this project is not a professional project, so it will not be updated over time unless I get the urge.
